# Unit-3-Lesson-1-Chapter-4-Model-Comparison
Create a Jupyter notebook with your models. At the end in a markdown cell write a few paragraphs to describe the models' behaviors and why you favor one model or the other. Try to determine whether there is a situation where you would change your mind, or whether one is unambiguously better than the other. Lastly, try to note what it is about the data that causes the better model to outperform the weaker model. Submit a link to your notebook below.
